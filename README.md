## Machine Learning Hands-on : Clustering

This project aims to demonstrate an attempt on Unsupervised Learning.

It is highly recommended that you get a [Virtual Environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) while locally testing out this project.

### Get started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will setup your environment. Once this is done, you need to open `city_employees_clustering.ipynb`.

```bash
jupyter notebook city_employees_clustering.ipynb
```

That's it!
